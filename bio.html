            I'm Wesley, but you already knew that. Anyway, this is the part
            where I ramble on about myself for a bit, so if you were looking
            for my Github, you should go
            <a href="https://github.com/946336">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was born in the United States but moved to Taiwan early in
            elementary school. I returned to the United States to attend Tufts
            University for my undergraduate studies. I am currently studying
            computer science.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I'm not eating, sleeping, or doing schoolwork, I'll tend to be
            working on whatever side project I've committed to at the time, be
            it programming-related or not. More recently I've become interested
            in interpreter and language design, but otherwise I prefer origami
            and papercraft to keep me from going insane.
